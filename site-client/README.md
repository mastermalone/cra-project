This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

### Creating Pages

Create a new component in the "Pages" directory
Create a container to import the component and import it.
Use "compose" to wrap your "react-redux connect" HOC and export it out as 'default'

### Creating a store

In my implementation, you create a store for your page by creating a function that returns an object whos properties contain the following:
{
types: [an array of the actions],
initialState: {
// The state that you page should start with
},
reducer: (state, action) => {
//The standard reducer switch cases
},
creators: a function that return an object that cotains your action creator functions as named propteries whos values are methods.
}

Export your store as default.

### Add your store to the configured store.

You must add your exported store to the "storeExports" file and export it from there as follows:
export { default as myStore } from './myPage/myStore';
Next you must include the export of your store to the configuireStore.js file in two places:

- Add it to the import statement along with the other stores
- The stores[] array

### Adding a route for your page

Be sure to update App.jsx with your page by adding a rout for it. Follow the examples in App.jsx
